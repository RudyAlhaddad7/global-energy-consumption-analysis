# Global Energy Consumption Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores global energy consumption data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The goal is to analyze how energy use changes across countries and years, and to visualize findings clearly.

## Dataset
- **Filename:** `data/global_energy_consumption.csv`
- **Description:** Open-source dataset containing global energy consumption statistics by country and year.

## Project Structure
```
data/        # Contains the dataset CSV file
notebooks/   # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis
src/         # Python scripts (data cleaning, visualization, etc.)
README.md    # Project summary and instructions
.gitignore   # Files/folders to ignore in git
```

## Workflow & TODOs
- [ ] Load and inspect data
- [ ] Clean/preprocess data
- [ ] Visualize key trends (country, year, energy type)
- [ ] Analyze consumption patterns
- [ ] Summarize findings and insights

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `notebooks/eda.ipynb` in VSCode/Jupyter.
3. Run the cells to explore the data!
